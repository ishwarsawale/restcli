Writing command Line REST API client in Go lang
  In this project I will share my experience with GOlang and why I chose to use it for building a command line REST API client when there is better client available in the eco system. My requirement was to make a rest call from a machine which might be of any flavor such may redhat, ubuntu, Debian or any other X based system. So I decided to write a tool that does not require any dependencies (it is necessary, I don't want anything to break on the production box) so I needed a binary at the end which can just do the work.

  I chose Golang for creating the tool, first, it is very fast a very close run to C and at the end, I will get my binary, no other dependency needed, it can run on any X based system natively.
